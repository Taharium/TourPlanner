- Description of UI
    ```
    On top of the Interface we have a search bar where the user can search for tours that are similar or for a specific tour. Beneath that on the left side, we have the tour list. Here, the user can add(+), modify(...) or delete(-) a tour. A new window pops up if the user decides to either add a tour or modify an existent tour. On the right side of the page, there are three tabs. In the general tab, there is the tour information (Date, Start Location, End Location, ...). In the route tab, there will be a map of the tour. In the Misc tab, there hasn't been a usecase yet. Beneath those tabs, there a the tour logs for a specific tour. Here you can also add(+), modify(...) or delete(-) a tour log. In the same way, new windows will pop up for adding or modifying a tour.
